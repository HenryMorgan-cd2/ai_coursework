\section{Implementation}

I implemented the neural network in JavaScript.
Treated ever layer as an independant object.
Then piping the output of one layer into the next the network could be made of an arbitrary number of layers allowing the library to expand to more generalized problems.

\section{Training}
\subsection{Network Selection}
allowed for up to 3 layers and upto 10 nodes in each
